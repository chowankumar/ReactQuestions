///////////Theory Question///////////////////////////

1===> Error[You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an 'onChange handler. This will render a read-only field. if the field should be mutable use 'defaultValye. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`?]When this error comes we will not write anything in the input. We Provide default value empty string so at any render it wanna be a empty value.




2==> SPREAD OPERATOR :: the spread operator (...)in js(React) allows an iterable (like an array of string) to be expanded into individual elements. it provides a consise way to spread the elements of an iterable object into places where multiple elements (arguments or elements in array literals) are expected.
SYANTX : 
Arrays  => const newArray = [...oldArray];
Objects => const newObject = {...oldObject};
useCases : Copying Array, Concating Arrays, Adding Elements to an Array, Spreading Object Properties.
